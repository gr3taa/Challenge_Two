- Documentation is clear and complete

- some warnings in the compilation 
    - see main.cpp
    - the in the call operators you should always return something
   
- uncompress() does not work with column wise storage

- resize() does not modify the matrix 
    
- no test with complex numbers

- a lot of code duplication in the implementation of the methods for different storage order
